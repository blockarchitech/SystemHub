# REPOSITORY ARCHIVED
# This is no longer being developed and *does not* work on windows 10 1809+ or ANY of the windows insider builds.

# If you insist on using this, original documentation is below.


































# SystemHub
A simple system hub for older laptops.

*Note: Some files may say Turn Off Computer., this was the original name for the code.*

# Install/Build
![SystemHub](/systemhub.png)

The eaisiest way to install is to directly download from the releases tab.
Once you download it it's click-and-run, no fuss!
This is *Does Not* install to your computer and if you delete it, there is no other file to delete.

## Install

There is no way to actually *install* the program on your computer.
A installer may come in the future.
